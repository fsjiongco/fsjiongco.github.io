			<h3>Favorite GE so far</h3>
				<p>Through my first two years of being a UPLB student, 
				<u><b>Ethics 1</b></u> is still the GE class I am most fond of.
				Through this subject, I was able to think a lot more 
				critically about a variety of topics.
				Ma'am Cassandra Teodosio's discussions kept me interested over the year. I was in awe at how easily she explained all of the concepts effortlessly. In addition, the short assessments were just right for stimulating my mind. With the aid of this subject, I was shocked at how I was able to condense a large number of thoughts into a sentence or two.
				</p>	

			<h3>Favorite CMSC subject so far</h3>
				<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is <u><b>CMSC 150: Numerical and Symbolic Computations</b></u>. 
				Before entering UPLB as a computer science major, I had very limited exposure to programming. 
				Therefore, the frustration and the satisfaction I felt,
				the eureka moments, and the trial and error I experienced
				amid this course showed me how much I have 
				grown and improved as a programmer. Besides, I've always enjoyed a good challenge, so the exercises in this course pushed me to my limits and allowed me to surpass my own standards.
				</p>	

			<h3>Favorite programming language so far</h3>
				<p>As yet, my favorite programming language is <u><b>java</b></u>. 
				While it seemed to be much more difficult at first, I soon discovered how simple and enjoyable this programming language is. I liked how organized the way programs are made in this environment. 
				Again, as a novice programmer, I was ecstatic when I was able to make games and programs through java.
